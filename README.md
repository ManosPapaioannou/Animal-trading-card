# Animal-trading-card
This is my first project from Udacity, while studying intro to programming, it's a basic webpage, using **html** and **css** and it should look like a card from a card trading game with our favourite animals.

## Documentation
All the documentation needed is provided.

## Quickstart 
Open the **html** file on any browser.

## Issues
I have been having troubles by making the background transparent, tried different ways but whatever I tried made the whole card transparent. Any help is welcome.

## License
MIT license, feel free to contribute to the project.
