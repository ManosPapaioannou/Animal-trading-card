			<p>Male House Sparrows are brightly colored birds with gray heads, white cheeks, a black bib, and rufous neck â€“ although in cities you may see some that are dull and grubby. Females are a plain buffy-brown overall with dingy gray-brown underparts. Their backs are noticeably striped with buff, black, and brown.</p>
